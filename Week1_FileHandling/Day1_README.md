# Day 1 - File Handling Basics

## ✅ Goals:
- Learn to write, read, and append files in Python.
- Understand `open()` modes.
- Practice using `with` context manager.

## 📂 What I did:
- Wrote a message to a file.
- Read & printed it.
- Appended a line & printed again.

## 🔍 Learnings:
- Files must be closed manually unless using `with`.
- Append mode won't erase previous data, it just adds on to existing data.
